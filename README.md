The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX, a renowned space exploration company, promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, offering a significantly lower cost of 62 million dollars compared to other providers whose prices can reach upwards of 165 million dollars per launch.The major cost savings for SpaceX is attributed to their ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Hence, by accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can effectively estimate the cost of a launch. This valuable information can be utilized by alternate companies interested in competing with SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
